# Cornerstone: Sell Shops

## Dependencies
- Ox lib
- Ox Target
- Ox Inventory

A simple script to create peds who will buy items from players. You can create as many buyers as you want, each with unique list of items they will purchase. 

The script assumes you have money set as an item. You can reward any item to the player that you want. If you are not using money as an item you will need to code that logic in yourself.

## Support

There is no support for this script. It was written for use with Ox inventory on a QBox server and will not be updated to support other inventories of frameworks. You are free to make those changes yourself.
